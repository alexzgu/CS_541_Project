| ID | Decision | Status |
|---|---|---|
| S1 legacy deletion | **delete** | done — ~7 GB removed, commit `d42a290cb`; golden sources preserved at `data/gold/source/` |
| S2 staged-song audio | **yes, but no downloads** | done — 27 t2-extra admitted from local audio (`kashi dataset admit`); corpus 86 train / 7 test (test frozen as `manifest.PAPER_TEST_IDS`); 70 t1/ro-unique stay label-staged until downloads are ever OK'd |
| S3 new scraping | **use existing local music** | done — pool = `~/Music/headphone music/wave1/{banger,good}`, 267 JP vocal mixes, registered as `paths.unlabeled_pool`; no scraping |
| S4 romaji first-class | **yes** | applies when t1/ro songs gain audio |
| S5 test-side gold listening | **no, foreseeable future** | reporting = frozen test vs v1 + train-side gold |
| S6 git commits | **yes, as checkpoints** | in effect (`Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5`) |
| S8 legacy 10 ms tensors (11 GB) | **delete** | done 2026-07-10 — `models/tensors/` and its 10 ms cache symlinks removed |
| S7 heavy compute | **Google Colab TPU available** — Claude writes notebook code, you paste & run | planned uses: P5.4 continued SSL pretraining on singing; optionally batch vocal separation of the pool (Colab GPU). A ready-to-paste notebook will be produced when P5.4 starts |
